# FIU ACM event-server

This is the FIU ACM's event-server
This program as of right now is an event-server that is an API that
accepts a .csv file and converts it into JSON and stores it in
a MongoDB instance and returns JSON in the following format.

Primary Maintainer: @ndneighbor (Angelo Saraceno)

As of right now, it is only a command line application- but in the
future we hope to extend it with a front end interface.

The program is written in Python 2.7, this will serve as the event backend
to show the capabilities of the Flask
